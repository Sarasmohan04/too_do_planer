# too_do_planer
Creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for your To-Do planner project using React and Spring Boot is a critical first step. Here's an outline to help you get started:

1. Introduction:
   - Provide an overview of the project.
   - Define the purpose and scope of the system.
   - List any definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the document.

2. System Description:
   - Describe the To-Do planner system in detail.
   - List the primary features and functionalities it will offer.

3. Functional Requirements:
   - Detail use cases and user stories.
   - Describe the functionalities, such as task creation, editing, categorization, setting due dates, user registration, authentication, etc.
   - Specify user roles and their permissions.

4. Non-Functional Requirements:
   - Performance requirements (e.g., response times, scalability).
   - Security requirements (authentication, data protection).
   - Compatibility with browsers and devices.
   - Maintainability and extensibility.

5. User Interface:
   - Describe the user interface design.
   - Include wireframes or mockups if available.

6. Database Design:
   - Define the database schema for storing tasks and user data.
   - Specify data storage and retrieval requirements.

7. System Architecture:
   - Provide a high-level system architecture using React and Spring Boot.
   - Describe how the front-end and back-end components interact.

8. External Interfaces:
   - Identify third-party integrations (e.g., email notifications, cloud storage for task synchronization).

9. Security Requirements:
   - Detail authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Address data protection and privacy concerns.

10. Testing and Quality Assurance:
    - Describe the testing approach, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
    - Outline quality assurance processes.

11. Deployment and Installation:
    - Specify how the system will be deployed.
    - Provide installation and configuration instructions.

12. User Documentation:
    - Include user manuals or guides for using and managing tasks within the To-Do planner.

13. Maintenance and Support:
    - Define plans for ongoing maintenance and support.

14. Appendices:
    - Include any additional information, diagrams, or reference materials.

15. Glossary:
    - Define any technical terms or acronyms used throughout the document.

Your SRS should be a living document, updated as the project progresses. Collaboration with developers, designers, and potential users is crucial for creating a comprehensive and effective SRS. Consider using SRS templates or tools to streamline the documentation process and ensure all project requirements are well-documented.
